          This project involved developing an intelligent WhatsApp-based AI assistant designed to streamline the grievance submission and redressal process for citizens. The assistant facilitated user-friendly, multilingual interactions, allowing citizens to submit well-structured, information-rich grievances effortlessly.

          **Key Features and Functionalities:**  
          - **Conversational Interaction:**  
            Citizens could converse with the bot in their preferred language (both text and audio), giving the experience of interacting with a human agent. The bot guided users through the grievance submission process, ensuring all required details were captured effectively.

          - **Spam Detection and Validation:**  
            The assistant incorporated robust spam filtering and user detail verification to ensure only valid grievances were processed. It also validated district and village names using **fuzzy logic** and **LLM function-calling capabilities** to assist users unfamiliar with the exact names of their locations.

          - **Advanced Classification with Custom BERT Model:**  
            Grievances were categorized into one of 100 departments using a **fine-tuned BERT-based classifier** with over **91% accuracy**. The system provided a list of the top 5 probable departments and their confidence scores, enabling informed decision-making.

          - **Enhanced Context Resolution with Azure OpenAI:**  
            For ambiguous cases or low-confidence classifications, the bot leveraged **Azure OpenAI** to prompt users for additional details, ensuring high-quality grievance submissions and reducing misrouting.

          - **Grievance Redressal Optimization:**  
            By providing detailed and accurate grievance information to the correct department, the system reduced average grievance resolution time by **30%**.

          - **Integration with Bhashini for Multilingual Support:**  
            The bot supported multiple languages for both text and audio chats, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility.

         **Impact:**  
          The assistant enabled citizens to raise grievances conveniently while significantly improving the efficiency of the grievance redressal system. By leveraging advanced AI models and intelligent design, it reduced resolution times by **30–40%**, enhanced grievance quality, and ensured accurate routing to appropriate departments, benefiting both users and government grievance redressal officers (GROs).

          This project demonstrates expertise in **AI-driven automation**, **natural language processing**, **multilingual support**, and integration with modern technologies like **Azure OpenAI** and **BERT**, showcasing its scalability and real-world impact.
